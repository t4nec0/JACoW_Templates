############        A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE         ############
###########################################################################

Many conference series have adopted the same standards for electronic 
publication and have joined the Joint Accelerator Conferences Website 
(JACoW) collaboration for the publication of their proceedings.

The "jacow.cls" class is used for submissions to the proceedings in LaTeX
in one of the 19 conferences in this series. The documents in this package 
describe the common requirements for the submission of papers to these 
conferences. Please consult individual conference information for page 
limits, method of electronic submission, etc. It is not intended that 
this should be a tutorial in word processing; the aim is to explain the 
particular requirements for electronic publication at www.JACoW.org.
